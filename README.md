# AI-WEEK-3

Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)
1. SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS.
Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
- PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph while TensorFlow traditionally used a static computation graph


Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
-Interactive Model Prototyping and Experimentation
-End-to-End AI Workflow Documentation


Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
1. Linguistic Intelligence vs. Raw Text Manipulation
- spaCy understands language structure—offering tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
 2. Built-in NLP Pipeline
- spaCy provides a modular pipeline that processes text step-by-step: tokenization → tagging → parsing → entity recognition.
3. Speed and Efficiency
- spaCy is written in Cython, making it lightning-fast and memory-efficient—ideal for large-scale text processing.
 4. Semantic Awareness
- spaCy supports word vectors and similarity comparisons, enabling semantic search and clustering.


2. Comparative Analysis

Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:

Target applications (e.g., classical ML vs. deep learning).
-Scikit-learn is ideal for traditional ML tasks like fraud detection or customer segmentation. TensorFlow excels in tasks requiring deep learning, such as autonomous driving or voice recognition.


Ease of use for beginners.
-Scikit-learn is often recommended as a first ML library due to its simplicity. TensorFlow offers more power but demands deeper understanding, especially when building custom models.

Community support.
-Both libraries have vibrant communities, but TensorFlow benefits from Google’s backing and a broader ecosystem for deployment and scaling.
